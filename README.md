# CPSC-331: Assignment 4 - Hash Tables & Searching

### Project Description:
Comparing the running times of linear search, binary search, and searching a hash table on the same set of data.

###### Contributors:
 - Sloman, Calder
 - Kalin, Carlene

#### To-Do List:
- [X] Initialize the project workspace (completed by @calderslom)
- [X] Implement Sort (completed by @calderslom) - Used the quicksort algorithm
- [X] Implement Binary Search (completed by @calderslom)
- [ ] Implement Hash Table population
- [ ] Implement Hash Table Search
- [ ] Graph runtimes of Sequential vs Binary Search
- [ ] Graph runtimes of Binary Search vs Hash Table Lookup


###
- The ValueGenerator Class will create a set of 999000 values in a text file in your working directory
	- we use these to populate our searchArray
	- this way our searchArrays will always have the same values as specified in the assignment
	- JUST RUN IT ONCE AND THEN COMMENT OUT THE LINE OF CODE. THAT WAY ALL TEST RESULTS WILL REMAIN CONSISTENT.

- IntegerFileReader Class reads this text file and returns an array of ints
	- just call it and supply it with whatever size you want as an argument and it will return an array of int
